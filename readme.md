# FastAPI Project with Docker Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance privacy mechanisms in web applications by creating a FastAPI-based backend served through a Docker container. The API provides endpoints for user consent management, detailing purpose specification and metadata about the data collected. This project aligns with the principles outlined in the research on Hippocratic APIs.

## Features

- **Privacy-Aware Consent Mechanisms**: Dynamic consent forms generated via FastAPI.
- **Docker Integration**: Easy deployment and environment consistency using Docker.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: API key-based authentication for accessing protected endpoints.
- **Automatic OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI.
